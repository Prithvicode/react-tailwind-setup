# react tailwind setup (rts)

This script automates the setup of a new React project using Vite, with options for TypeScript or JavaScript and includes Tailwind CSS. 

## Motivation

I wanted to quickly set up my projects without the hassle of copying and pasting multiple commands. So why not write a script to automate it? This script simplifies the process, allowing me to focus on building my applications.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm** must be installed on your system.
- The folder containing `rts.bat` must be added to your environment variables.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Open Command Prompt**: Navigate to the folder where you want to set up your frontend project.

2. **Run the Script**: Type `rts` and press **Enter**.

3. **Enter Project Details**: When prompted, enter the project name and specify whether to use TypeScript or JavaScript. For example:
4. ```
   Enter project-name and TypeScript option (e.g., my-project t or my-project j): my-project-name t 
   ```
